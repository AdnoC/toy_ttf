A toy .ttf renderer written in Rust.

Very much work in progress.

Currently working on: Rendering multiple characters

* Kerning?

* Placing the glyph bitmap in place

* Interpreter for instructions? Or is that for single characters?

* Just parsing what is necessary

* Leave error-handling for later, just panic for now
